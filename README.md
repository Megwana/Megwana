## 🌈 Passions Beyond Code :

When I'm not coding, you can find me indulging in my diverse set of hobbies. I find solace and joy in playing tunes on my guitar. An avid sports enthusiast, I have a special penchant for racket sports, where the thrill of competition meets the finesse of technique. Additionally, I relish the great outdoors—whether it's hiking through scenic landscapes or hitting the trails for a refreshing run. Beyond the realms of code, these pursuits not only define my interests but also contribute to what I consider to be a well-rounded and vibrant lifestyle. While coding invites me into the intricate world of algorithms and creativity indoors, many of my hobbies invite me outdoors, providing a harmonious balance.
